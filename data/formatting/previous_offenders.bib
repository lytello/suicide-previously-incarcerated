	abstract = {Background
              High levels of psychiatric morbidity in prisoners have been documented in many countries, but it is not known whether rates of mental illness have been increasing over time or whether the prevalence differs between low–middle-income countries compared with high-income ones.
            
            
              Aims
              To systematically review prevalence studies for psychotic illness and major depression in prisoners, provide summary estimates and investigate sources of heterogeneity between studies using meta-regression.
            
            
              Method
              Studies from 1966 to 2010 were identified using ten bibliographic indexes and reference lists. Inclusion criteria were unselected prison samples and that clinical examination or semi-structured instruments were used to make DSM or ICD diagnoses of the relevant disorders.
            
            
              Results
              
                We identified 109 samples including 33 588 prisoners in 24 countries. Data were meta-analysed using random-effects models, and we found a pooled prevalence of psychosis of 3.6\% (95\% CI 3.1–4.2) in male prisoners and 3.9\% (95\% CI 2.7–5.0) in female prisoners. There were high levels of heterogeneity, some of which was explained by studies in low–middle-income countries reporting higher prevalences of psychosis (5.5\%, 95\% CI 4.2–6.8;
                P
                =0.035 on meta-regression). The pooled prevalence of major depression was 10.2\% (95\% CI 8.8–11.7) in male prisoners and 14.1\% (95\% CI 10.2–18.1) in female prisoners. The prevalence of these disorders did not appear to be increasing over time, apart from depression in the USA (
                P
                =0.008).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              High levels of psychiatric morbidity are consistently reported in prisoners from many countries over four decades. Further research is needed to confirm whether higher rates of mental illness are found in low- and middle-income nations, and examine trends over time within nations with large prison populations.},

              N
              = 476) matched to the Violent Death Reporting System are analyzed to estimate rates and demographic and criminal justice–related predictors. Violent death rates for persons released from prison were more than 7 times higher than for the general adult population. Results from multinomial logistic regression indicate decreased homicide risk for every year of age, whereas male gender and minority race increased risk. For suicide, minority race, release without supervision, and substance abuse treatment in prison decreased fatality risk. By contrast, a history of mental illness increased suicide risk. Implications for practice and research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objectives To estimate overall and cause specific standardised mortality ratios in young offenders. Design Comparison of mortality data in cohort of young offenders. Settings State of Victoria, Australia. Subjects Cohort of young offenders aged 10-20 years with a first custodial sentence from 1 January 1988 to 31 December 1999. Main outcome measures Deaths ascertained by matching with the national death index, a database containing records of all deaths in Australia since 1980. Death rates in the reference Victorian population used to calculate standardised mortality ratios.
Results The offender cohort comprised 2621 men and 228 women with 11 333 person years of observation. The median age of first detention was 17.9 years for men and 18.4 years for women. Median follow up was 3.3 years for men and 1.4 years for women. Overall standardised mortality ratio adjusted for age (expressed as a ratio) was 9.4 (95\% confidence interval 7.4 to 11.9) for men and 41.3 (20.2 to 84.7) for women. Cause specific standardised mortality ratios for men were 25.7 (17.9 to 36.9) for drug related causes, 9.2 (5.8 to 15) for suicide, and 5.7 (3.6 to 9.2) for non-intentional injury. A quarter of drug related deaths in men aged 15-19 years were in offenders.
Conclusions Social policies for young offenders should address both the prevalent drug and mental health problems as well the high levels of social disadvantage.},

	abstract = {Objective—Released prisoners have high suicide rates compared with the general population, but little is known about risk factors and possible causal pathways. We conducted a populationbased cohort study to investigate rates and risk factors for suicide in people previously imprisoned.
Methods—We identified individuals released from prison in Sweden between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009 through linkage of national population-based registers. Released prisoners were followed from the day of release until death, emigration, new incarceration, or December 31, 2009. Survival analyses were conducted to compare incidence rates and psychiatric morbidity with non-convicted population controls matched on gender and year of birth.
Results—We identified 38,995 releases among 26,953 prisoners (7.6\% females) during 2005-2009. Overall, 127 suicides occurred, accounting for 14\% of all deaths after release (n=920). The mean suicide rate was 204 per 100,000 person years yielding an incidence rate ratio of 18.2 (95\% CI 13.9-23.8) compared with general population controls. Previous substance use disorder (Hazard Ratio [HR]=2.1, 1.4-3.2), suicide attempt (HR=2.5, 1.7-3.7), and being born in Sweden vs. abroad (HR=2.1, 1.2-3.6) were independent risk factors for suicide after release.
Conclusions—Released prisoners are at high suicide risk and with a slightly different pattern of psychiatric risk factors for suicide compared with the general population. Results suggest appropriate allocation of resources to facilitate transition to life outside prison and increased attention to prisoners with both a previous suicide attempt and substance use disorder.},

	title = {The mortality of released {Finnish} prisoners; a 7 year follow-up study of the {WATTU} project},
	abstract = {Objective. The aim was to compare the mortality of released prisoners and the general population.
Method. The study forms a part of the Health Survey of Finnish Prisoners (the WATTU Project). A sample (N5903), representing all Finnish male prisoners, underwent a thorough health survey in 1985. A 7 year follow-up study was performed by means of gathering register data (deaths, hospital care, diseases leading to working incapacity). A population-based age-selected control group was formed for comparison.
Results. During the follow-up, 13.2\% of the sample died (natural deaths 5.2\%, accidental deaths 4.1\%, suicides 2.0\%), whereas the corresponding ﬁgure in the control group was 3.4\%. Overmortality among released prisoners, when compared to the general population, was also found in different death categories.
Conclusion. The high somatic and psychiatric morbidity and mortality due to prisoner suicide, when imprisoned, has been reported in many earlier studies. This is probably the ﬁrst study to conﬁrm the high mortality in different death categories of a representative sample of released prisoners compared to a control group representing the general population. It is important to try to help released prisoners to get a new grip on normal life, especially if they also have somatic or mental health problems. More effort should be made to improve the collaboration between different health care systems. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

The causes of deaths that occurred during this 25-year period are examined using data from the Netherlands Statistics. Results show that criminal conduct increases the chance of premature death due to natural and unnatural causes. Convicted persons run greater risks of dying of unnatural causes such as accidents, homicide, and suicide. Additionally, risk of premature, unnatural death varies, with high-rate, persistent offenders evincing higher risks than other types of offenders.},

	abstract = {There is a growing body of research on the effects of incarceration on health, though there are few studies in the sociological literature of the association between incarceration and premature mortality. This study examined the risk of male premature mortality associated with incarceration. Data came from the Izhevsk (Russia) Family Study, a large-scale population-based case-control design. Cases (n = 1,750) were male deaths aged 25 to 54 in Izhevsk between October 2003 and October 2005. Controls (n = 1,750) were selected at random from a city population register. The key independent variable was lifetime prevalence of incarceration. I used logistic regression to estimate mortality odds ratios, controlling for age, hazardous drinking, smoking status, marital status, and education. Seventeen percent of cases and 5 percent of controls had been incarcerated. Men who had been incarcerated were more than twice as likely as those who had not to experience premature mortality (odds ratio = 2.2, 95 percent confidence interval: 1.6–3.0). Relative to cases with no prior incarceration, cases who had been incarcerated were more likely to die from infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, non–alcohol-related accidental poisonings, and homicide. Taken together with other recent research, these results from a rigorous case-control design reveal not only that incarceration has durable effects on illness, but that its consequences extend to a greater risk of early death. I draw on the sociology of health literature on exposure, stress, and social integration to speculate about the reasons for this mortality penalty of incarceration.},

The data consisted of all 132 women who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations after committing homicide or attempted homicide in 1982±1992. We analysed their rate and cause of death during follow-up using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and the of®cial classi®cation of death. The mean follow-up time for dead subjects was 7 years (S.D. 4), and for the rest 11 years (S.D. 3). There were 22 observed deaths, the expected value being 1.3 (SMR 17.4). The SMR for unnatural deaths was 226 and for suicides 425. The SMRs for women below 40 years were over 220. In conclusion, homicidal women have an over 200-fold risk of unnatural death, rising to over 400-fold for suicide.

	abstract = {Objectives. We compared mortality of ex-prisoners and other state residents to identify unmet health care needs among former prisoners.
Methods. We linked North Carolina prison records with state death records for 1980 to 2005 to estimate the number of overall and cause-speciﬁc deaths among male ex-prisoners aged 20 to 69 years and used standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare these observed deaths with the number of expected deaths had they experienced the same age-, race-, and cause-speciﬁc death rates as other state residents.
Results. All-cause mortality among White (SMR = 2.08; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI] = 2.04, 2.13) and Black (SMR = 1.03; 95\% CI = 1.01, 1.05) ex-prisoners was greater than for other male NC residents. Ex-prisoners’ deaths from homicide, accidents, substance use, HIV, liver disease, and liver cancer were greater than the expected number of deaths estimated using death rates among other NC residents. Deaths from cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes were at least 30\% greater than expected for White ex-prisoners, but less than expected for Black ex-prisoners.
Conclusions. Ex-prisoners experienced more deaths than would have been expected among other NC residents. Excess deaths from injuries and medical conditions common to prison populations highlight ex-prisoners’ medical vulnerability and the need to improve correctional and community preventive health services.

	abstract = {Background Previous research has demonstrated elevated mortality following release from prison. We contrasted the risk of opioid overdose death with the risk of suicide in a cohort of adults released from prison in Queensland, Australia over a 14-year-period. We examine risk factors for suicide in the cohort, and make comparisons with the general population.
Method We constructed a retrospective cohort of all adults released from prison between 1994 and 2007 and linked this to the National Death Index for deaths up to 31 December 2007.
Results We identiﬁed 41 970 individuals released from prison. Of the 2158 deaths in the community, 371 were suicides (crude mortality rate (CMR) 13.7/10 000 person-years) and 396 were due to drug-related causes (CMR 14.6/10 000 person-years). We observed a spike in drug-related deaths in the ﬁrst 2 weeks after release from prison but no such pattern was observed for suicide. Being married (HR 0.40) and number of prior imprisonments (HR 3.1 for ≥5 prior incarcerations compared with none) independently predicted suicide. Age, sex, Indigenous status, length of incarceration and offence history were not associated with suicide. The standardised mortality ratios indicated that released women were 14.2 times and released men 4.8 times more likely to die from suicide than would be expected in the population.
Conclusions This study demonstrates that the rate of suicide in adults released from prison is similar to the rate of drug-related deaths. Strategies that provide support to vulnerable people after release may reduce suicide in this population.},
